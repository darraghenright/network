# Define a network called `network`. The full network name 
# will be concatenated from the `COMPOSER_PROJECT_NAME` and
# the network name; i.e: `api_network`. This can then be 
# referenced locally with its local name `network` and in 
# other Docker Compose stacks that are configured to use the
# same network, with it's fully qualified name `api_network`.
#
# See `service/docker-compose.yaml` for more details.
